A campus accessibility guide is a website that provides information on the accessibility of a university campus for students with disabilities. The guide typically includes information on the accessibility of buildings, classrooms, and facilities on campus, as well as information on accessibility services and resources available to students.

Here are some features in the campus accessibility guide:

-Building accessibility: The guide can provide information on the accessibility of buildings on campus, including the location of accessible entrances, elevators, and restrooms. The guide can also include photos and descriptions of the buildings to give students a better idea of what to expect.

-Classroom accessibility: The guide can provide information on the accessibility of classrooms on campus, including the location of accessible seating, desks, and other equipment. The guide can also include photos and descriptions of the classrooms to help students plan ahead.

-Campus transportation: The guide can provide information on accessible transportation options on campus, such as shuttle buses or vans, as well as information on accessible parking options.

-Accessibility services and resources: The guide can provide information on the accessibility services and resources available to students on campus, such as disability services offices, assistive technology centers, and tutoring services.

-Interactive maps: The guide can include interactive maps of the campus that allow students to search for accessible buildings, classrooms, and facilities.

Overall, a campus accessibility guide can help to improve the experience of students with disabilities by providing them with the information they need to navigate the campus more easily. The guide can also help to raise awareness of accessibility issues on campus and promote a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all students.
